**The GTPB e-Learning project**

This repository is a state-of-the-art of the e-learning series of experiments held by The Gulbenkian Training Programme in Bioinformatics (GTPB). 
These experiments were inspired by the [GOBLET/ELIXIR-EXCELERATE Workshop on e-learning](https://github.com/alexcaetano/GTPB_Elearning/blob/master/GOBLET_ELIXIR_Workshop_elearning_SaraPetiz_21112017.pdf) hosted by the GTPB and that took place at Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência (IGC). 

Currently, we are focusing in the Development phase of the ADDIE Model for Instructional Design, particularly in Building Learning Objects.





**Building Learning Objects and Shareable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM)**



- **Why is it important to develop scorm contents?**

      • To be able to reuse contents
    
      • To be able to share contents to other LMS
    
      • To be able to share performance results from participants
    

For a more comprehensive reference about what a SCORM is and how it works you can access: [here](https://scorm.com/scorm-explained/) and [here](https://scorm.com/scorm-explained/scorm-resources/scorm-cookbook/) or [here](https://scorm.com/wp-content/assets/cookbook/CookingUpASCORM_v1_2.pdf).

- **The SCORMs produced**

 For experimental purposes we aimed to explore as many different strategies as possible, namely:
 
      [x] Develop e-learning content from scratch
      
      [x] Develop e-learning content based on the documentatioo rrom F2F courses
      
      [x] Develop e-learning content from an online course website in html
      
  And experimented with some different resources to accomplish our goal. For instance:
  
      [x] Producing SCORMs using Adapt Authoring Tool
      
      [x] Producing SCORMs using other software tools
      
      [x] Importing SCORMs to a Learning Management System (LMS), in particular Moodle Cloud
      

So far we produced e-learning content for four themes hosted by the GTPB. Below you can find a detailed description of what you will find in each output (i.e. SCORM).

     - **Research Data Management**

This course is being created by Rutger Vos in collaboration with the GTPB team. 
It consists of a experiment to create Shareable Content Objects using different softwares [(see here)](https://github.com/naturalis/markdown2scormhere), with the aim to integrate them in the LMS, maintaining the intended structure. This need was recognized by the necessity of, for example, convert markdown to SCORM, since the majority of the GTPB courses are built in markdown. 

It was chosen to create the self-assessment quizzes in The Adapt Authoring tool. You can download the resulting SCORM [in here](https://github.com/alexcaetano/GTPB_Elearning/blob/master/SCORMs/data_management_assessment.zip) and upload it to the LMS of preference.
